# System Integration

The SolanaVault Pro integration architecture is built around three main layers that work together to provide a secure and efficient multisig solution. At its core, the Solana Devnet hosts the MultisigProgram, which interacts with various program accounts including MultisigState for configuration, Transaction accounts for proposals and approvals, and Token Vault accounts for asset management. This on-chain architecture ensures all critical data and operations are handled securely on the blockchain, with each component maintaining its specific role in the overall system.

The frontend application layer connects to the blockchain through a combination of Wallet Adapter for secure key management and RPC connections for data transfer. This layer handles user interactions through a Next.js UI, allowing users to create and manage multisig wallets, propose and approve transactions, and monitor wallet activity. Development tools, including the Anchor CLI and Test Client, complete the architecture by providing necessary utilities for deployment, testing, and development. All transaction history and audit data are accessed directly through Solana's native RPC methods, eliminating the need for additional indexing services and maintaining a streamlined, efficient architecture that meets all core requirements while minimizing complexity.
